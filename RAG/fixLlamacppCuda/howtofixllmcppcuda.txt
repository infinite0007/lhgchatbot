To Fix it read and just redo this thread. I did it without .venv: https://github.com/Granddyser/windows-llama-cpp-python-cuda-guide or mine forked: https://github.com/infinite0007/windows-llama-cpp-python-cuda-guide
follow the steps until Visual Studio with C++ Developeroptions installed and Cuda installed:

Important step is to uninstall the current VERSION of llama-cpp-python
pip uninstall llama-cpp-python

then open Powershell as Administrator and run step by step:
$env:FORCE_CMAKE="1"
$env:CMAKE_ARGS="-DGGML_CUDA=on"
$env:CUDA_CXX="C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.1\bin\nvcc.exe"
pip install llama-cpp-python[server] --upgrade --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir

after the running is done it works like a charm.
